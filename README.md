This repository dockerizes [jnbarlows'](https://github.com/jnbarlow) [dashboard](https://github.com/jnbarlow/monero-dashboard) for monitoring a monero node. On it's own running this container does nothing. For information on how you can use it with a monero node, please visit [my other repository](https://github.com/hvalev/monero-node).
